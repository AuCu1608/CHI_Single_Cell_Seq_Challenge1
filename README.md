# Code for H1 of the COVID-19 Data Hackathon at IEEE Healthcare Summit

The raw data files, "covid-selected-data.csv" and "covid-selected-data-labels.csv" should be added to the folder "scBALFdata" to run the codes.

For non-NN classifiers, e.g. random forest and xgboost, just run "non_nn_classifiers.py" alone to get the performance.

For our proposed attention-based neural network model, run "main.py" and obtain results from the folder "test_results".
